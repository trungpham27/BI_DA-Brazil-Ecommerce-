## 1. Description
   
The dataset includes information about 100,000 orders made at Olist Store, the largest e-commerce platform in Brazil. After a customer purchases a product from Olist Store, the seller will receive a notification to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer will receive an email satisfaction survey where they can take notes about their purchase experience and write down some feedback.

Data will include information related to customers, products, shipping, payments, revenue... of orders. Our ultimate goal is to build a complete Business Intelligence model for relevant data and find useful insights from analyzing cleaned, selected and modeled data.

## 2. Tasks

- Perform ETL to clean and extract data from database into Data Warehouse.

- Conduct data modeling and visualization to discover existing problems in the enterprise's business processes.
